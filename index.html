            <p class="typed">The Download Inspector  project is a web browser extension/application that intercepts<br> download requests from the browser and checks the requested files for malicious software using<br> an API and database. The goal of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is to provide basic <br>functionality for users to safely download files without worrying about potential malware infections.</p>

            <h2>Inpiration</h2>
            <p>This project was inspired by a problem many people face when browsing the internet.<br> There are often misleading links that pretend to be download links, but <br>they can actually be dangerous and put your personal information at risk. We  addressed this<br> issue by creating a tool called the "Download Inspector." Instead of having to open a <br>separate application to check a link's safety, we made it a browser extension<br> for convenience. This means you can easily use it while browsing<br> any tab without the need for extra steps.</p>
